Today I will show you how to deploy a basic web GIS application using Docker. Docker will host two containers, a Django container and a PostGIS container. The Django backend serves as a proxy so that the web application does not have to make calls directly to the hosted database. Let's start by setting up the PostGIS database and loading data into it. Instructions how to install docker on Ubuntu may be found here[1]


In your project folder create a folder called postgis, and inside that folder create a new Dockerfile. 

FROM kartoza/postgis:9.6-2.4
Docker uses volumes to store the data. use the VOLUME command to show 
VOLUME "/data"
ENV POSTGRES_USER=user
ENV POSTGRES_PASS=password
ENV POSTGRES_DBNAME=gis
EXPOSE 5432
'

After saving your Dockerfile, tag and build image.

'$ docker build -t postgis .'

now run the container. 

'docker run -d postgis'

Now we will need to insert data into your database to be retrieved by the webapp. Open up psql and log into the database.
